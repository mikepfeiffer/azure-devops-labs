## What is Azure DevOps?

Azure DevOps provides developer services to support teams to plan work, collaborate on code development, and build and deploy applications. Developers can work in the cloud using Azure DevOps Services or on-premises using Azure DevOps Server, formerly named Visual Studio Team Foundation Server (TFS).

Azure DevOps provides an integrated set of features that you can access through your web browser or IDE client.
